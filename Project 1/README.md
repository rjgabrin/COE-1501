This is the README for the first project of 1501 Algorithm Implementation.

The goal of this project in the first part is to generate a recursively-called function that generates a wordsearch and solves the result.
The goal of this project in the second part is to make it compatible with a DLB class and then compare the two implementations with one another to demonstrate the capabilities of a DLB.
